    <h1>The Buena Vista Resort and Spa in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to your dream getaway. Sun, sand, and relaxation awaits you....</h2>

    <p>The Buena Vista Resort and Spa in Cabo San Lucas offers a European Plan (accommodations only)
      in addition to an all-inclusive add on. Please be certain to specify the correct vacation plan
      when booking through one of our Travel Consultants. The all inclusive plan is the only plan
      available when booking online.</p>

    <p>Located on the pristine and beautiful Medano Beach, only one mile from downtown Cabo San Lucas,
      Buena Vista Pacifica Resort and Spa offers upscale, affordable luxury at a spacious Mediterranean-
      style resort. Guests can enjoy views of the Sea of Cortez and the famous El Arco, the signature
      rock formation at Land's End, which is one of Cabo's most famous landmarks. The calm waters of
      Medano Beach make it one of the most swimmable beaches in Cabo, since some areas are not. So with
      the beach and pools to swim in and a variety of outdoor activities, The Buena Vista Resort and Spa
      offers guests a great way to enjoy nature and have some fun in the sun.</p>

    <p>One of the best ways for fun in the sun is to enjoy a drink by the pool. The sprawling pool
      beckons with shimmering waters, and with poolside bars, guests can enjoy their favorite cool
      drink, alcoholic or not, as they relax in a lounge chair. Or guests can visit one of the three
      on-site restaurants that offer scrumptious food and amazing views of the resort or the sea. In
      addition, other restaurants are included in the all inclusive plan at nearby Pueblo Bonito
      resorts (a free shuttle is provided). With Italian, Mediterranean, seafood, and international
      dishes, mealtime will be a favorite time during your stay at Buena Vista Pacifica Resort and Spa.
      In addition to top quality cuisine, live music and other entertainment is provided, especially
      during theme nights at Mare Nostrum restaurant.</p>

    <p>Other activities on site at the resort include cooking classes, Spanish classes, bingo, arts and
      crafts, ping pong, a fitness center, tennis ($), water aerobics, and more. Kids will delight in
      the activities at the Kid's Club for those ages four to 11 ($). For those who want additional
      adventure, a large variety of tours and excursions can be booked through the resort for a fee.
      These include golf at one of the nearby championship-level golf courses, deep sea fishing, scuba
      diving or snorkeling, horseback riding, whale watching, boat cruises, ziplining, ATV rentals, and
      so much more. Enjoy a botanical tour or a tour of the nature preserve. Or take a water taxi over
      to the famous arches at Land's End.</p>

    <p>One of the best activities when you stay at The Buena Vista Pacifica Resort is a visit to downtown
      Cabo San Lucas. After all, the nearness of the downtown is one of the best advantages of staying at
      the Buena Vista Pacifica Resort and Spa. With shopping, restaurants, bars, and nightlife nearby,
      and the Puerto Paraiso mall, which has a bowling alley, casino, and a movie theater, it's no wonder
      that Cabo is such a popular vacation spot. The number of excursions and activities, both on-site
      and off, means that your vacation will be anything but boring.</p>

    <p>However, for those who don't want to be on the go all of the time, there are certainly wonderful
      ways to relax. The Armonia Spa on site was named one of the Top 10 Hotel Spas of Mexico, Central
      and South America by the readers of Travel + Leisure magazine. This European-style spa offers the
      ultimate in relaxation, renewal, and regeneration through treatments such as massage therapies,
      body scrubs, body wraps, facials, and more. Signature treatments include the Temazcal steam bath,
      which includes a ceremony for purification and cleanliness. Jantsu is an energetic therapy done
      underwater to take you into a deep state of peaceful meditation. And Watsu is a water therapy
      that uses Shiatsu and yoga techniques to strengthen the mind/body connection.</p>


    <p>For accommodations, The Buena Vista Pacifica Resort and Spa offers suites only. Plush bedding;
      blackout drapes; a private balcony; a TV with satellite; a fully equipped kitchenette (on request)
      with a refrigerator, cook top, coffeemaker, microwave, dishes, and cutlery offer ultimate luxurious
      living. Premium amenities, such as a feather-top mattress, pillow menu, plush bathrobes, and premium
      towels and linens make Pueblo Bonito Rose stand out from other hotels in the area. And the friendly
      staff that sees to your every need adds an extra touch to your stay.</p>
